          He was a hard-working engineer at a top tech company, where he worked his way up, earning the respect and admiration of everyone. His career was going great, he had finally bought a home, gotten married, and each promotion meant more opportunities for his growing family. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg opacity-80 leading-relaxed text-center">
          But the rise of AI changed everything. The technology started taking over simple coding tasks but it got more complex. Slowly, the company he loved began to favor machines for their coding speed and cost-effectiveness, leading to mass layoffs.

        <p className="text-lg opacity-80 leading-relaxed text-center">
          One day, he was told his job was no longer needed. Losing his job was just the beginning of his troubles. He tried to get a new job but he found that his skills were outdated, replaced by the very technology he thought would make him more productive.
